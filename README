This is yet another Lua glib binding.  See the top of lua-glib.c for
overview, and generate the HTML documentation (lua-glib.html) for complete
documentation.  The build is done using Odin, available as a separate
project.  Or you can just read the overview and Odinfile and figure it
out for yourself.  It's just one C file; compile into a shared object
with lua and GLib libraries.

This was built and tested using GLib 2.32.  It should work with
versions as far back as 2.26, with a few missing features (documented
as such; look for "available with GLib" or "ignored with GLib" in
lua-glib.html).  The reason 2.26 was chosen is that it is the oldest
version permitted with the GLIB_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED macro, even though
I could've gone as low as 2.18 without significant loss of
functionality.
